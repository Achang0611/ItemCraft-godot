description = "The scale of horizontal knockback resisted from attacks and projectiles. Vertical knockback is not affected. Does not affect explosions.[4] The resistance functions as a percentage from 0.0 (0% resistance) to 1.0 (100% resistance) (e.g. 0.4 is 40% resistance, meaning the attributed mob will only take 60% of usual knockback). Note that Iron Golems and Wardens suffer zero knockback from attacks or projectiles."
