description = "Movement speed is the speed at which entities can move, but this is not the actual speed value in blocks/second. The mob's actual speed in blocks/second is a bit over 20 times this value, but is affected by various conditions, such as the behavior it's following (e.g. idling, attacking or fleeing), being ridden (if a horse), sprinting, being led by a leash, and being under the effect of a Speed or Slowness potion. Baby mobs also have an additional speed multiplier on top of the base value."
