ItemCraft is a Minecraft `give` command generator created using the **Godot** game engine. It allows users to customize items with a graphical interface by adjusting item properties, custom names, lore, enchantments, and more. The program then generates the corresponding command, enabling users to easily create items in Minecraft.

## Installation

The project was developed using **Godot_v4.2.2**.

You can download the required version from the [Godot official website](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.2.2-stable/).

## Usage

### Selecting an Item

1. **Search for the required item**: You can easily find the item you need by searching.
2. **Tooltip**: Hovering over an item will display its name.
